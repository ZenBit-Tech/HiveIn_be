1-create your .env file and follow the .env.example to create the right conection between the Api and the database, you need the .env because the API and the docker-compose.yml file share the same variables

2-run docker-compose up command to run the database and phpMyAdmin container wich you can access using the port 8080 (if you don't have it installed you can learn here how to do it here https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

3- run npm run start:dev to run the api

4-start coding! :)
